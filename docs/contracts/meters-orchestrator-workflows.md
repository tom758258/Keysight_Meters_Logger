# Meters Orchestrator Workflows

Common schema version: `2`

Compatibility policy: `v2-only`

Implementation status: `Common v2-only conformant`

This document gives subprocess-oriented workflows for agents that drive the
Keysight meter CLI. Shared lifecycle guidance is defined in
[Common Orchestrator Workflows](common-orchestrator-workflows.md). Shared event
envelope rules are defined in
[Common CLI JSON / JSONL Contract](common-cli-jsonl-contract.md). Meters event
fields are defined in
[Meters CLI JSON / JSONL Contract](meters-cli-jsonl-contract.md), and meter
worker endpoints are defined in
[Meters Worker Contract](meters-worker-contract.md).

The current Meters implementation supports Common schema `2` only. Do not send
schema `1` or attempt fallback or version negotiation.

## Invocation Forms

The Meters contracts define CLI/worker subprocess behavior, not a required
binary packaging format. A conforming worker may be launched through any
equivalent subprocess command, including:

- `meters-tool ...` from an installed Python package.
- `meters-tool.exe ...` from a packaged Windows executable.
- `python -m meters_tool_cli ...` in a development checkout.

The invocation form is valid only when it preserves the documented stdout
JSON/JSONL behavior, local control endpoints, process exit codes, artifacts,
and `run_id` correlation rules. Direct in-process Python API calls, such as
importing core runner functions, are outside this CLI/worker subprocess
contract unless a separate Python API contract defines them.

## Model Context

Meters context is fixed at startup. Live model selection is an
`expected_model_id` guard; simulate and dry-run selection is a
`planning_model_id`. Meters does not use `planning_profile_id`, and command
requests do not override startup context.

Use `meters-tool capabilities --json` to discover the default Core capability
view, or add `--model MODEL` to inspect one registered profile. This command
performs no live identity detection or VISA I/O. A requested capability profile
does not become a live runtime driver override; live runs still use detected
identity and Core Product support policy.

## Simulator Software Trigger Workflow

Use a simulator-only worker for automated orchestration tests. The worker emits
JSONL on stdout; client commands emit one JSON object to stdout when called
with `--json` or `--format json`.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import json
import subprocess
import sys

port = 8765
worker = subprocess.Popen(
    [
        sys.executable,
        "-u",
        "-m",
        "meters_tool_cli",
        "start-trigger-record",
        "--resource",
        "SIM::34461A",
        "--simulate",
        "--trigger-mode",
        "software",
        "--max-samples",
        "1",
        "--status-format",
        "jsonl",
        "--sw-trigger-port",
        str(port),
        "--csv",
        "samples.csv",
    ],
    text=True,
    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
    stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
)

try:
    assert worker.stdout is not None
    ready = None
    for line in worker.stdout:
        event = json.loads(line)
        if event["event"] == "ready":
            ready = event
            break
    assert ready is not None
    assert ready["schema_version"] == 2

    wait_ready = subprocess.run(
        [
            sys.executable,
            "-m",
            "meters_tool_cli",
            "wait-ready",
            "--port",

    status = subprocess.run(

            "-m",
            "meters_tool_cli",

    )
    status_result = json.loads(status.stdout)
    assert status_result["schema_version"] == 2
    assert status_result["run_id"] == ready["run_id"]

    command_result = subprocess.run(
        [
            sys.executable,
            "-m",
            "meters_tool_cli",
            "send-command",
            "--port",
            str(port),
            "--json",
        ],
        text=True,
        capture_output=True,
        check=True,
    )
    command_response = json.loads(command_result.stdout)
    assert command_response["schema_version"] == 2
    assert command_response["status"] == "accepted"
    assert command_response["command"] == "software_trigger"

    for line in worker.stdout:
        event = json.loads(line)
        if event["event"] == "summary":
            assert event["schema_version"] == 2
            assert event["ok"] is True
            assert event["captured"] == 1
            assert event["errors"] == 0
            break
    assert worker.wait(timeout=10) == 0
finally:
    if worker.poll() is None:
        subprocess.run(
            [
                sys.executable,
                "-m",
                "meters_tool_cli",

                str(port),

            text=True,
            capture_output=True,
            check=False,
        )
        worker.terminate()
```

## Orchestrator-Owned Sample Persistence

Keep the preceding `--csv samples.csv` workflow when Meters should own its CSV
artifact. When the orchestrator owns persistence instead, replace those two
arguments with `--no-csv`. Persist the complete raw stdout JSONL stream, not
only its `sample` events, while separately parsing events needed for control
and sample storage:

```python
worker_args = [
    *worker_args_without_csv,
    "--status-format",
    "jsonl",
    "--no-csv",
]

for line in worker.stdout:
    persist_stdout_jsonl(line)
    event = json.loads(line)
    if event["event"] == "sample":
        persist_measurement(event)
```

For a complete scheduler job history, the orchestrator should retain:

1. The submitted request and effective launch configuration before starting
   Meters. This may be the command/argv or the scheduler's canonical request
   representation.
2. The complete unmodified Worker stdout JSONL stream, including `ready`,
   `status`, `sample`, `error`, `message`, and final `summary` events.
3. Worker stderr as diagnostics. Stderr does not replace structured pass/fail
   evaluation.
4. The final `summary` event and process exit code.
5. An orchestrator-owned terminal result that correlates the scheduler job
   identity, Meters `run_id`, final summary, and process exit code.
6. Scheduler-owned sample persistence derived from JSONL `sample` events when
   `--no-csv` is used.

A non-zero process exit, a missing final summary, or `summary.ok: false` makes
the run failed or incomplete under the existing Common and Meters contracts.
The terminal result should record that outcome; stderr alone must not decide it.

An orchestrator might choose an artifact layout such as:

```text
request.json
stdout.jsonl
stderr.txt
result.json
samples.csv
```

These names and the containing layout are entirely orchestrator-owned examples,
not Meters Worker artifact names or a new runtime schema. Meters does not create
or manage these files. In particular, an orchestrator may create `samples.csv`
from JSONL `sample` events while Meters runs with `--no-csv`.

If Meters should own CSV persistence instead, keep the existing `--csv PATH` or
default CSV workflow. Do not layer a new storage contract on top of it.
`persist_stdout_jsonl`, `persist_measurement`, and terminal-result construction
are orchestrator responsibilities. Meters creates no CSV file or CSV-only
parent directory with `--no-csv`, and its `ready`, `status`, `summary`, process
exit, `run_id`, and Common `schema_version: 2` semantics remain unchanged.

## Readiness And Status

For Meters workers, the `ready` JSONL event and `wait-ready --json` mean the
local `/command`, `/stop`, and `/status` endpoints can accept requests. They do
not mean a measurement has completed.

Use `status --json` or direct `GET /status` as a non-mutating status
check. Verify that returned `run_id` values match the worker stdout JSONL for
the current run.

## Trigger And Stop

Use `send-command --json` or direct `POST /command` for software-triggered
Meters measurement requests. The Common v2 command envelope includes exact
integer `schema_version: 2` and omits `context` because Meters binds it at
startup. Use `stop --json` or direct `POST /stop` for cooperative cleanup.

Treat `send-command` exit `2` as local or worker validation failure. Treat
HTTP `409`, `429`, other request failures, and invalid response bodies as exit
`3`. The JSON diagnostics echo worker `command`, `job_id`, `reason`, `error`,
and `message` fields when available.

If the process has already exited, `stop` may return
`status: "already_stopped"` with exit code `0`; this remains a successful
cleanup result for orchestrators.

## Live Mode Resource Rule

Live mode must use an explicit `--resource` selected by the operator or by a
previous explicit discovery step. Do not scan, guess, or rotate through VISA
resource strings inside an orchestrator. A live acquisition subprocess should
fail closed when `--resource` is missing or does not match the intended
instrument.
